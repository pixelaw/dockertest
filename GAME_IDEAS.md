# Treasure Hunter
For example, Treasury Hunter Event. like...
Paint and you have a certain chance of finding it?
There will be a prize if someone finds the treasure and reports it to the team.

The implementation is to calculate the hash value by adding up the timestamp and coordinates. If the last three digits are 0(which means 0.1%), how about making text (emoji) a star?

Then, have the stars reported on the discord.
It would be preferable if there is proof that it is the user who found the star, but I am thinking that the first person to report it on the discord would get the right.

What do you think about this implementation, which can be implemented with only minor changes to the text portion of the current contract?


It might be hard, but I think it's a good way to get people excited about pixelaw.
